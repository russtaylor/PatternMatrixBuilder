Pattern Matrix Model Builder
============================

This Amos plugin is made with the intent to simplify the creation of models based on pattern 
matrices in SPSS. It allows pasting the copied contents of a pattern matrix into a dialog box and 
constructs the applicable model in Amos.

Installation
------------
Copy `PatternMatrixBuilder.dll` into Amos' `Plugins\` directory. 

Usage
-----
In Amos, select the data set that corresponds to your pattern matrix. Click Plugins > Pattern Matrix
Model Builder, select your pattern matrix in SPSS, Right click > Copy. In Amos, paste your copied 
matrix into the input box. Then, click 'Create Diagram'. The model may take several minutes to 
generate, but could be quick depending on the size of your model.
